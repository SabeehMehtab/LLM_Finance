# LLM for financial forecast
This project is about using LLM's for analysing financial reports of companies listed in [Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX)](https://financials.psx.com.pk/).
They can be useful to draw insights from the reports and summarize them, or provide a judgement on the companies finances. The LLM models solely for this purpose are, yet, limited, but are in the process of being developed. 
Hence, this project utilizes currently developed LLMs (see list below), with the following two approaches, implemented to carry out the same task of fetching and analysing reports from PSX.
